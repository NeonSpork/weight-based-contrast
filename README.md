# Weight based contrast

A simple widget to show some anonymized data in a scatterplot.

## Requirements to develop

[node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (included with `node`) are necessary, as is a browser of your choice.

## Run a development server locally

First install all the necessary packages.  
Navigate to the correct folder `cd /where/you/cloned/this/weight-base-contrast` and run `npm install` (or `npm i` if you're lazy).  
Run the command `npm run dev` and open your browser to (http://localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000].
